## Quick Start

```bash
npx github:dmauser/network-desk init
```

That's it. Launch Copilot CLI with experimental mode (`copilot --experimental`) in any repo and trigger the extension with **`@network-desk`** followed by what you need:

```
@network-desk design a hub-spoke VNet topology for a 3-tier app across dev/staging/prod
```

```
@network-desk generate Palo Alto rules to allow HTTPS from my app subnet to a backend on port 8443
```

The coordinator picks the right specialist automatically and responds in plain language — no tool names to remember.

## What is Network Desk?

Network Desk gives you a coordinated team of network specialist agents through [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli). Describe what you need — VNet design, firewall rules, DNS troubleshooting, hybrid connectivity, IaC generation, container networking, SASE architecture — and the coordinator routes your request to the right specialist automatically.

Each specialist operates within a defined area of domain expertise, supported by tailored guardrails and structured workflows. The coordinator is responsible for routing requests and orchestrating cross-domain interactions, eliminating the need for users to manage or select individual tools.

> **Analysis only** — Network Desk produces designs, configurations, IaC templates, and analysis for human review. It generates deployment code but does not execute deployments, modify live firewalls, or make changes to production networks.

## The Team

> The `specialist` column is the value the coordinator passes internally (e.g. `cn_role({ specialist: "cn_vnet" })`). The bare forms (`vnet`, `fw`, …) are still accepted as aliases. You never type these — just describe what you need after `@network-desk`.

### Firewall Vendors (14)

Azure Firewall · AWS Network Firewall · GCP Cloud Firewall / Cloud Armor · Palo Alto (PAN-OS / Panorama / VM-Series / Prisma) · Fortinet FortiGate (FortiOS / FortiManager) · Check Point (R81+ / SmartConsole / CloudGuard) · Cisco ASA / FTD · Juniper SRX / vSRX · Zscaler (ZIA / ZPA) · Sophos XG / XGS · OPNsense · pfSense · VyOS · iptables / nftables

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli) installed and authenticated
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Experimental mode** (user-level install only) — enable with `copilot --experimental` or `/experimental` inside Copilot CLI. Not needed for project-level install (`init --project`)

### Option A — User-level install (recommended)

The fastest way to install globally. Extensions load in every repo but require **experimental mode**:

```bash
npx github:dmauser/network-desk init
```

Then launch Copilot with experimental mode:

```bash
copilot --experimental
```

This will:
1. Create `~/.copilot/extensions/network-desk/` if it doesn't exist
2. Copy the extension router and all 20 specialists
3. Remove any conflicting individual specialist extensions
4. Display a summary of what was installed

### Option B — Project-level install (no experimental mode needed)

Installs the extension into the current repo's `.github/extensions/` directory. Works without experimental mode, but only for this repo.

> **Important:** You must run this from inside a git repository. If you don't have one yet, run `git init` first.

```bash
# cd into your repo first
cd my-repo
npx github:dmauser/network-desk init --project
```

Then launch Copilot normally from the repo:

```bash
copilot
```

This will:
1. Create `.github/extensions/network-desk/` in the current repo
2. Copy the extension router and all 20 specialists
3. Add the extension directory to `.gitignore` (each developer runs init themselves)

### Option C — Global install via npm

If you prefer a persistent CLI command instead of `npx`:

```bash
npm install -g github:dmauser/network-desk

# User-level install (requires experimental mode)
network-desk init

# Or project-level install (no experimental mode needed)
network-desk init --project

# Now available as a command:
network-desk status
network-desk --version
```

### Option D — Install from inside Copilot CLI

Already have Copilot CLI open? You can install directly from the prompt — just ask Copilot to clone the repo and run the installer for you:

```
Clone https://github.com/dmauser/network-desk.git and run `node bin/cli.mjs init` from the cloned directory.
```

Or if you already cloned the repo and are inside it:

```
Run `node bin/cli.mjs init` to install the network-desk extensions.
```

Copilot will execute the commands, copy the extensions into `~/.copilot/extensions/network-desk/`, and confirm the result. After installation, restart Copilot CLI to load the new extensions, then verify with:

```
show me the network-desk capabilities
```

### Option E — Manual install (offline / corporate environments)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand manual steps</summary>

Use this if you're behind a corporate proxy or don't have access to npm/npx.

**Step 1 — Clone the repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmauser/network-desk.git
cd network-desk
```

**Step 2 — Copy to your Copilot extensions directory:**

macOS / Linux:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.copilot/extensions/network-desk
cp -r extensions/network-desk/* ~/.copilot/extensions/network-desk/
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
$dest = "$env:USERPROFILE\.copilot\extensions\network-desk"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $dest | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Path "extensions\network-desk\*" -Destination $dest -Recurse -Force
```

**Step 3 — Verify the files are in place:**

```bash
ls ~/.copilot/extensions/network-desk/
# Should show: extension.mjs  specialists/
```

</details>

### Verify installation

After any install method, check that everything is in place:

```bash
# If you used Option A or B:
npx github:dmauser/network-desk status

# Or launch Copilot CLI and ask:
copilot
> show me the network-desk capabilities
```

You should see all 20 specialists listed with their tools.

### Updating

The extension automatically checks GitHub for a newer version on each session start (throttled to once every 24h, fully non-blocking, never blocks load). When an update is available, you'll see a one-line `network-desk: update available — installed X.Y.Z, latest A.B.C` notice in the session log.

To update, run the **`update`** command — it auto-detects whether you have a user-level install, a project-level install (in the current repo), or both, and re-installs each in place:

```bash
npx github:dmauser/network-desk update
```

Equivalent shortcuts (any of these re-pulls the latest):

```bash
# Re-run init explicitly (replaces the existing install)
npx github:dmauser/network-desk init             # user-level
npx github:dmauser/network-desk init --project   # project-level

# If installed globally
npm install -g github:dmauser/network-desk
network-desk update
```

**Opt out of auto-check.** Set the environment variable `NETWORK_DESK_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable the periodic GitHub poll entirely.

Each install records its version in `<install-dir>/.install-meta.json`, and `network-desk status` will display it alongside the install date.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what's new in each release.

### Uninstall

```bash
# Using the CLI:
npx github:dmauser/network-desk uninstall

# Or manually:
# macOS / Linux
rm -rf ~/.copilot/extensions/network-desk
# Windows (PowerShell)
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.copilot\extensions\network-desk"
```

## CLI Reference

The `network-desk` CLI manages installation of the Copilot extensions. You can run it via `npx` or install it globally.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `network-desk init` | Install/reinstall extensions to `~/.copilot/extensions/` |
| `network-desk init --project` | Install extensions to `.github/extensions/` in current repo |
| `network-desk update` | Re-install over any existing user-level and/or project-level install (pulls latest from GitHub) |
| `network-desk status` | Check installation status, version, and list available specialists |
| `network-desk uninstall` | Remove installed extensions |
| `network-desk --version` | Print the installed CLI version |
| `network-desk help` | Show CLI help |

The extension also performs an **automatic update check** against GitHub once every 24 hours when a Copilot session starts, and prints a one-line notice if a newer version is available. Set `NETWORK_DESK_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable. This is the extension's only outbound network request — see [Privacy](#privacy) / [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## How It Works

Trigger the extension with **`@network-desk`** anywhere in your prompt — or just ask a networking question. The coordinator announces itself at session start, auto-detects networking intent (even without the `@` mention), picks the right specialist(s), loads their role and skills behind the scenes via the registered tools, and replies in natural language. Each routing hint is shown once per specialist per session to keep the conversation clean.

   Specialists run their domain workflows and the coordinator

```

You never need to call individual tools — just describe what you need after `@network-desk` and the coordinator handles the rest.

> Report Builder is a **packaging** specialist — it turns another specialist's analysis into a deliverable. It does not perform networking analysis itself. Generated files land under `network-desk/<specialist>/reports/` (see [Output files](#output-files)). Rendering to PDF/DOCX/XLSX uses the bundled Python renderers (`renderers/make_*.py`); when a dependency is missing the skill falls back to Markdown/HTML.

```
```
@network-desk which specialists cover firewalls and what do they do?
```
```
@network-desk I need to set up private endpoints for my storage accounts — who should handle this?
```

## Output files

Specialists are **analysis-first** and return their findings inline in the chat. When you ask for a saved artifact — a diagram, a rendered report, or a spreadsheet model — files are written into a predictable tree rooted at `network-desk/` in your current working directory:

```
network-desk/
└── <specialist>/            # kebab dir name, e.g. firewall-engineer, capacity-planner
    ├── diagrams/            # Mermaid / Excalidraw / draw.io sources
    ├── reports/             # Markdown / HTML / PDF / DOCX deliverables
    └── configs/             # generated configs / IaC / specs
```

Files are named `<kebab-topic>-<YYYYMMDD>.<ext>` by default (e.g. `rule-audit-20260115.pdf`). Example:

```
network-desk/
├── firewall-engineer/
│   ├── reports/rule-audit-20260115.pdf
│   └── configs/east-west-policy-20260115.json
└── capacity-planner/
    └── reports/ip-plan-20260115.xlsx
```

The bundled Python renderers (`extensions/network-desk/renderers/make_{html,pdf,docx,xlsx}.py`) honor this layout: pass `--specialist <kebab-dir>` and they resolve the output path automatically (override with `--output`/`--outdir`). The [Report Builder](#-report-builder) specialist orchestrates these renderers for high-quality reports.

### Installed extension structure

After running `network-desk init`, the installed layout mirrors the `extensions/network-desk/` tree above:

```
~/.copilot/extensions/network-desk/
├── extension.mjs                          # Router + auto-routing hook
└── specialists/                           # All 20 specialist directories
    └── (same structure as above)
```

### Specialist directory conventions

All specialists follow a standard layout:

```
specialist-name/
├── agents/
│   └── specialist-name.md    # Agent persona, workflow, guardrails
└── skills/
    ├── skill-name/
    │   └── SKILL.md          # Detailed skill instructions
    └── another-skill/
        └── SKILL.md
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Extensions not loading (`/env` shows "Extensions: none") | Enable experimental mode: `copilot --experimental` — or use project-level install: `network-desk init --project` |
| Tools not appearing after install | Restart Copilot CLI to reload extensions |
| `@network-desk` doesn't engage | Verify `~/.copilot/extensions/network-desk/extension.mjs` exists; run `network-desk status` |
| Specialist tools missing | Run `network-desk status` to check — should list all 20 specialists |
| Conflicting individual extensions | Run `network-desk init` — it removes old standalone specialist installs |
| `npx` hangs or fails | Use Option E (manual install) — clone the repo and copy files directly |
| Firewall config for unsupported vendor | Check the [14 supported vendors](#firewall-vendors-14) list |
| Version mismatch after update | Run `network-desk status` — compare CLI version vs installed version |

## Privacy

Network Desk is a **local, read-only** extension. It collects **no telemetry** and never
transmits your prompts, code, or generated files. Its only outbound request is an optional
once-per-24-hours version check against GitHub, which you can disable with
`NETWORK_DESK_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.

See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for full details on what data is accessed, what leaves your
machine, the local files written, and your controls.
