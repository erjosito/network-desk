## Quick Start

```bash
npx github:dmauser/cloud-networking init
```

That's it. Launch Copilot CLI with experimental mode (`copilot --experimental`) in any repo and start asking networking questions.

## What is Cloud Networking?

Cloud Networking gives you a coordinated team of network specialist agents through [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli). Describe what you need — VNet design, firewall rules, DNS troubleshooting, hybrid connectivity — and the coordinator routes your request to the right specialist automatically.

Each specialist runs with its own domain expertise, guardrails, and workflow. The coordinator handles routing and multi-domain orchestration so you don't have to remember which tools to call.

> **Analysis only** — Cloud Networking produces designs, configurations, and analysis for human review. It does not deploy infrastructure, modify live firewalls, or make changes to production networks.

## The Team

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli) installed and authenticated
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Experimental mode** (user-level install only) — enable with `copilot --experimental` or `/experimental` inside Copilot CLI. Not needed for project-level install (`init --project`)

### Option A — User-level install (recommended)

The fastest way to install globally. Extensions load in every repo but require **experimental mode**:

```bash
npx github:dmauser/cloud-networking init
```

Then launch Copilot with experimental mode:

```bash
copilot --experimental
```

This will:
1. Create `~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking/` if it doesn't exist
2. Copy the extension router and all 11 specialists
3. Remove any conflicting individual specialist extensions
4. Display a summary of what was installed

### Option B — Project-level install (no experimental mode needed)

Installs the extension into the current repo's `.github/extensions/` directory. Works without experimental mode, but only for this repo.

> **Important:** You must run this from inside a git repository. If you don't have one yet, run `git init` first.

```bash
# cd into your repo first
cd my-repo
npx github:dmauser/cloud-networking init --project
```

Then launch Copilot normally from the repo:

```bash
copilot
```

This will:
1. Create `.github/extensions/cloud-networking/` in the current repo
2. Copy the extension router and all 11 specialists
3. Add the extension directory to `.gitignore` (each developer runs init themselves)

### Option C — Global install via npm

If you prefer a persistent CLI command instead of `npx`:

```bash
npm install -g github:dmauser/cloud-networking

# User-level install (requires experimental mode)
cloud-networking init

# Or project-level install (no experimental mode needed)
cloud-networking init --project

# Now available as a command:
cloud-networking status
cloud-networking --version
```

### Option D — Install from inside Copilot CLI

Already have Copilot CLI open? You can install directly from the prompt — just ask Copilot to clone the repo and run the installer for you:

```
Clone https://github.com/dmauser/cloud-networking.git and run `node bin/cli.mjs init` from the cloned directory.
```

Or if you already cloned the repo and are inside it:

```
Run `node bin/cli.mjs init` to install the cloud-networking extensions.
```

Copilot will execute the commands, copy the extensions into `~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking/`, and confirm the result. After installation, restart Copilot CLI to load the new extensions, then verify with:

```
show me the cloud-networking capabilities
```

### Option E — Manual install (offline / corporate environments)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand manual steps</summary>

Use this if you're behind a corporate proxy or don't have access to npm/npx.

**Step 1 — Clone the repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmauser/cloud-networking.git
cd cloud-networking
```

**Step 2 — Copy to your Copilot extensions directory:**

macOS / Linux:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking
cp -r extensions/cloud-networking/* ~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking/
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
$dest = "$env:USERPROFILE\.copilot\extensions\cloud-networking"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $dest | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Path "extensions\cloud-networking\*" -Destination $dest -Recurse -Force
```

**Step 3 — Verify the files are in place:**

```bash
ls ~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking/
# Should show: extension.mjs  specialists/
```

</details>

### Verify installation

After any install method, check that everything is in place:

```bash
# If you used Option A or B:
npx github:dmauser/cloud-networking status

# Or launch Copilot CLI and ask:
copilot
> show me the cloud-networking capabilities
```

You should see all 11 specialists listed with their tools.

### Updating

To update to the latest version, re-run the install command. It safely replaces the existing installation:

```bash
npx github:dmauser/cloud-networking init
```

### Uninstall

```bash
# Using the CLI:
npx github:dmauser/cloud-networking uninstall

# Or manually:
# macOS / Linux
rm -rf ~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking
# Windows (PowerShell)
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.copilot\extensions\cloud-networking"
```

## CLI Reference

The `cloud-networking` CLI manages installation of the Copilot extensions. You can run it via `npx` or install it globally.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cloud-networking init` | Install/reinstall extensions to `~/.copilot/extensions/` |
| `cloud-networking init --project` | Install extensions to `.github/extensions/` in current repo |
| `cloud-networking status` | Check installation status and list available specialists |
| `cloud-networking uninstall` | Remove installed extensions |
| `cloud-networking help` | Show CLI help |

## How It Works

```
User prompt
    │
    ▼
Cloud Networking Extension (~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking/extension.mjs)
    │
    ├─ Auto-routing hook detects networking keywords
    │   └─ Injects routing context → "use fw_* tools for firewall config"
    │
    ├─ cn_capabilities → full map of all 11 specialists
    ├─ cn_route → explicit routing for any query
    │
    └─ Specialist extensions provide the actual tools
        ├─ vnet_role, vnet_orchestrate, vnet_skill_hub_spoke_design, ...
        ├─ fw_role, fw_orchestrate, fw_skill_config_gen, ...
        └─ ntsh_role, ntsh_orchestrate, ntsh_skill_packet_capture, ...
```

### Typical workflow

Each specialist follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Load the role** — call `<prefix>_role` (e.g. `fw_role`) to load the specialist's persona and workflow
2. **Orchestrate** — call `<prefix>_orchestrate` for step-by-step guidance
3. **Run skills** — call individual `<prefix>_skill_*` tools to perform the work

You don't need to call these manually — just describe what you need and the routing hook handles it.

## Usage Examples

Just describe what you need in plain language — the router picks the right specialist automatically.

### Installed extension structure

After running `cloud-networking init`, the installed layout mirrors the `extensions/cloud-networking/` tree above:

```
~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking/
├── extension.mjs                          # Router + auto-routing hook
└── specialists/                           # All 11 specialist directories
    └── (same structure as above)
```

### Specialist directory conventions

All specialists follow a standard layout:

```
specialist-name/
├── agents/
│   └── specialist-name.md    # Agent persona, workflow, guardrails
└── skills/
    ├── skill-name/
    │   └── SKILL.md          # Detailed skill instructions
    └── another-skill/
        └── SKILL.md
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Extensions not loading (`/env` shows "Extensions: none") | Enable experimental mode: `copilot --experimental` — or use project-level install: `cloud-networking init --project` |
| Tools not appearing after install | Restart Copilot CLI to reload extensions |
| `cn_capabilities` not found | Verify `~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking/extension.mjs` exists |
| Specialist tools missing | Run `cloud-networking status` to check — should list all 11 specialists |
| Conflicting individual extensions | Run `cloud-networking init` — it removes old standalone specialist installs |
| `npx` hangs or fails | Use Option E (manual install) — clone the repo and copy files directly |
| Firewall config for unsupported vendor | Check the [14 supported vendors](#firewall-vendors-14) list |
| Version mismatch after update | Run `cloud-networking status` — compare CLI version vs installed version |
