## [Unreleased]

### Added — `cn_`-prefixed specialist ids, presence note, and stronger routing

- **Specialist ids are now `cn_`-prefixed** (`cn_vnet`, `cn_fw`, `cn_dns`, …) for a consistent namespace. They are the canonical value for the `specialist` argument and appear in all `cn_route` / `cn_capabilities` / `cn_orchestrate` output. The bare forms (`vnet`, `fw`, …) and directory names remain accepted as aliases, so nothing breaks.
- **Session-start presence note** (`onSessionStart`) announces the extension, its 19 specialists, and the discovery tools from turn 1 — so the agent never claims cloud-networking is unavailable. A belt-and-suspenders fallback re-injects it on the first prompt for older CLI builds.
- **Direct-mention handling**: naming the extension (`@cloud-networking`, or just "cloud-networking") injects an imperative instruction to call `cn_capabilities` first and offer concrete example prompts.
- **Per-specialist throttling**: each routing hint is injected at most once per session to avoid crowding the context window.
- **Hardened routing guidance**: the hook now uses imperative MUST language, requires calling the matched specialist's `cn_role` **before** answering (no answering from prior/general knowledge), and explicitly **prohibits reading the `specialists/**` files directly** — all specialist content must be loaded via `cn_role` / `cn_orchestrate` / `cn_skill`.
- **Specialist emoji icons** surfaced in `cn_capabilities`, `cn_orchestrate`, `cn_route`, the routing hints, and the README team table.
- Broadened the mention pattern to match `cloud-networking` with or without a leading `@`.

### Fixed — Exceeded the 128-tool API limit (extension failed to load)

The extension registered ~162 tools (per-specialist `*_role`, `*_orchestrate`, and ~121 `*_skill_*` tools). The Copilot CLI/model enforces a hard **128-tool limit**, so every request was rejected with *"Request failed due to a transient API error. Retrying..."* and the extension was unusable.

Tools are now **parameterized** instead of registered per specialist — **5 tools total**, well under the limit:

- `cn_capabilities` — full specialist/skill map
- `cn_route({ query })` — recommends the specialist(s) and the exact calls to make
- `cn_role({ specialist })` — loads the specialist role definition
- `cn_orchestrate({ specialist })` — returns the workflow + skill catalog
- `cn_skill({ specialist, skill })` — loads a specific skill's deep guidance

Other changes:

- Introduced a single `REGISTRY` object (prefix → `{ dir, domain, trigger, guidance, skills }`) as the source of truth; routing, capabilities, orchestration prompts, and skill loading are all generated from it.
- `cn_skill` tolerates legacy names (e.g. `vnet_skill_address_planner`) and underscores as the `skill` argument, normalizing them to kebab-case.
- Hook/orchestrator guidance now points only at the 5 parameterized tools and explicitly notes that legacy `*_role`/`*_skill_*` names are references, not callable tools.
- Added startup registry validation (verifies every role/skill `.md` exists, regexes compile, prefixes are unique) that logs issues without crashing.

No specialist or skill was removed — all 19 specialists and 119 skills remain available through the parameterized tools.

### Added — Tier 1 specialist coverage (10 new skills)

Implements the highest-priority "clear coverage gaps" identified in the specialist-improvement audit. All skills follow the standard template (purpose · decision tree · per-vendor reference · workflow · verification checklist · references) and end with the analysis-only guardrail.

Orchestrator prompts (`ORCHESTRATORS.fw`, `.lb`, `.dns`, `.hyb`, `.nsec`, `.ntsh`, `.vwan`, `.nmon`, `.price`) updated to include the new skill names so the routing layer engages them automatically.

### Added — Deep PCAP analysis skill (network-troubleshooter)
- New skill **`ntsh_skill_pcap_analysis`** dedicated to deep packet-capture analysis with Wireshark, tshark, and the surrounding toolchain (capinfos, editcap, mergecap, reordercap, text2pcap, Zeek, ngrep, pyshark/scapy).
- Complements (does not replace) `ntsh_skill_packet_capture`: capture-side mechanics stay there; analysis-side workflows move into the new skill. The orchestrator pairs the two automatically.
- Coverage: capture profiling (`capinfos`), tshark cheatsheet (TCP retransmissions, RTT, throughput, zero-window stalls, DNS latency, TLS handshake inspection, HTTP timing, fragmentation, microbursts), Wireshark Statistics & Expert Info navigation, six diagnostic playbooks (slow downloads, TLS failures, jitter, asymmetric routing, MTU, NAT/SNAT exhaustion), dual-point capture merging, decryption (TLS keylog, IPsec, WireGuard, Kerberos), anonymization for safe sharing, and cloud-specific PCAP source gotchas (Azure Network Watcher, AWS VPC Traffic Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, container netns, service mesh sidecars).
- Updated `network-troubleshooter` agent to reference Wireshark/tshark/Zeek and point at the new skill.
- Tool count: 145 → 146.

### Added — Auto-update check and `update` command
- The extension now performs a **lightweight automatic update check** against GitHub on session start. Behavior: at most once every 24 h, ~4 s network timeout, fully async, never blocks extension load, fails silently on any error. When a newer version is detected, a one-line `cloud-networking: update available — installed X.Y.Z, latest A.B.C. Run \`npx github:dmauser/cloud-networking update\` to upgrade.` notice is written to the session log.
- Opt-out via `CLOUD_NETWORKING_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` environment variable.
- New CLI command **`cloud-networking update`** (alias `upgrade`) — auto-detects whether the user has a user-level install, a project-level install, or both, and re-installs each in place by pulling the latest from `github:dmauser/cloud-networking`.
- New CLI flag **`cloud-networking --version`** / `-v` to print the installed CLI version.
- Install metadata is now recorded at `<install-dir>/.install-meta.json` (version, install type, install timestamp) at every `init` / `init --project`, and surfaced by `cloud-networking status`.
- README's "Updating" section rewritten to document the auto-check, the new `update` command, the opt-out env var, and a pointer to `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude the runtime `.install-meta.json` and `.update-check.json` files anywhere in the tree.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-18

### Added — `@cloud-networking` mention trigger
- New explicit invocation: type **`@cloud-networking`** anywhere in a prompt to engage the extension. The `onUserPromptSubmitted` hook recognizes the mention (case-insensitive, accepts `@cloud-networking`, `@cloud_networking`, `@cloudnetworking`) and always engages the router, even when no specialist keyword matches.
- When mentioned without a keyword match, the router instructs the model to silently call `cn_route` (and `cn_capabilities` if still ambiguous) to pick the right specialist before responding.
- Routing context now tells the model to respond in **natural language** rather than exposing internal tool names to the user.

### Added — Excalidraw and draw.io diagram skills (vnet-architect)
- `vnet_skill_excalidraw_diagram` — generates `.excalidraw` JSON (hand-drawn / whiteboard style), suitable for slides, workshops, and design reviews. Always prefers official Azure / AWS / GCP icon libraries from [libraries.excalidraw.com](https://libraries.excalidraw.com).
- `vnet_skill_drawio_diagram` — generates `.drawio` XML with native cloud-provider stencils (`mxgraph.azure2`, `mxgraph.aws4`, `mxgraph.gcp2`, `mxgraph.kubernetes`). Suitable for polished, presentation-ready architecture diagrams and PNG/SVG/PDF export.

### Changed — Diagram policy (Mermaid is the primary format)
- `vnet_skill_network_diagram` is now declared the **default** diagram format for every design output. It renders inline in GitHub, VS Code, and most chat clients with zero setup.
- New 3-tier icon-selection order, enforced across all three diagram skills:
  1. **Official cloud-provider icons** (Iconify refs in Mermaid `architecture-beta`: `logos:microsoft-azure`, `logos:aws`, `logos:google-cloud`, `logos:kubernetes`; native stencils in draw.io; community libraries in Excalidraw).
  2. **Emoji fallback** for clients that don't render Iconify or for vendor firewalls without stencils — full mapping table included (🛡️ firewall, 🔐 VPN gateway, ⚡ ExpressRoute, ⚖️ load balancer, 🌐 VNet, 🔒 PrivateLink, 🏢 on-prem, ☁️ internet, 🐳 container, …).
  3. **Plain text label** with the canonical product name as a last resort.
- Every Mermaid diagram now ends with a built-in offer to also generate the diagram as Excalidraw or draw.io on request — alternative formats are **opt-in** and never produced by default.
- Updated the `vnet-architect` agent persona and the VNet orchestrator prompt to enforce this policy.

### Changed — README and user-facing examples
- All usage examples rewritten as natural-language prompts prefixed with **`@cloud-networking ...`** (every specialist and every multi-domain example, ~60 examples in total).
- "How It Works" rewritten to highlight the `@cloud-networking` mention as the trigger — no more `cn_capabilities` / `cn_route` / `<prefix>_role` plumbing in user-facing documentation.
- "Discovery" section rewritten as natural-language asks ("what can you help me with?", "which specialists cover firewalls?").
- Quick Start now shows two natural-language invocation examples.
- Troubleshooting row about `cn_capabilities` replaced with one about `@cloud-networking` not engaging.
- New **Changelog** link in the table of contents.

### Internal
- Bumped tool count from 143 → 145 (two new diagram skills).
- Reinstalled to `~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking/` with `cloud-networking init`.
