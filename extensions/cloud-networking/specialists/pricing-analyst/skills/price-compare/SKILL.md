## Common Workload Scenarios

### Small: Single-site, basic LB, 100 GB egress

| Component | Azure | AWS | GCP |
|---|---|---|---|
| VPN Gateway (S2S) | $263 (VpnGw1AZ) | $36.50 | $109.50 (HA VPN) |
| Load Balancer (L4) | ~$1 (Std LB) | $16.43 (NLB) | $18.25 |
| Internet Egress (100 GB) | $8.70 | $9.00 | $12.00 (Premium) |
| DNS Zone + Queries | $1.00 | $1.00 | $0.60 |
| Public IP (1) | $3.60 | Free | $2.92 |
| **Total/month** | **~$277** | **~$63** | **~$143** |

### Medium: ExpressRoute/DX + VPN backup, App Gateway, 1 TB egress

| Component | Azure | AWS | GCP |
|---|---|---|---|
| Circuit (500 Mbps/1 Gbps) | $550 (ER Metered) | $219 (DX 1 Gbps) | $550 (Partner 1 Gbps) |
| Circuit egress (1 TB) | $25 | $20 | $20 |
| VPN backup | $263 (VpnGw1AZ) | $36.50 | $109.50 |
| L7 Load Balancer | $180 (AppGW v2) | $16.43 (ALB) + ~$60 LCU | $18.25 + ~$10 |
| Firewall | $912 (Standard) | $864 (3 AZ) | $912 (NGFW) |
| NAT Gateway | Gateway uptime + data processing + public IPs; verify calculator | Gateway uptime + data processing + public IPv4; verify AWS VPC pricing | Gateway uptime + data processing + public IPs; verify Cloud NAT pricing |
| **Total/month** | **~$2,008** | **~$1,294** | **~$1,665** |

### Large: Multi-region, Front Door/CDN, 10 TB egress

| Component | Azure | AWS | GCP |
|---|---|---|---|
| Global LB + CDN | $943 (Front Door Premium) | $931 (ALB + CloudFront) | $883 (Global LB + CDN) |
| ER/DX (2 regions) | $2,200 | $438 | $3,400 (Dedicated) |
| Circuit egress (10 TB) | $250 | $200 | $200 |
| VPN backup (2 regions) | $526 | $73 | $219 |
| Firewall (2 regions) | $1,824 | $1,728 | $1,824 |
| Private Endpoints (20) | $146 | $146 (per AZ) | ~$0 (forwarding rule) |
| DNS + Traffic Routing | $10 | $10 | $5 |
| **Total/month** | **~$5,899** | **~$3,526** | **~$6,531** |

> **Key takeaway:** AWS tends to be cheapest at all scales primarily due to lower VPN and Direct Connect port costs. Azure wins on L4 LB cost (nearly free). GCP Cloud NAT must be modeled with gateway uptime, data processing, public IP, and egress charges. Actual costs depend heavily on specific SKU choices, commitment discounts, and EA/EDP pricing.

## Hidden Costs to Watch

| Hidden Cost | Cloud | What Happens | Typical Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Inter-AZ data transfer | AWS | $0.01/GB each direction for cross-AZ | $20/TB — adds up in multi-AZ |
| NAT Gateway processing | All | $0.045/GB on top of egress | $45/TB — often overlooked |
| Health probe traffic | Azure/AWS | LB health probes consume bandwidth | Minimal but non-zero |
| DNS query costs | All | $0.40/million queries | Significant at millions/day |
| Public IP idle charges | All | Charged even when unused | $3-7/month per IP |
| Peering bidirectional | Azure/AWS | Both sides pay for peering traffic | 2× the expected cost |
| TGW data processing | AWS | $0.02/GB through Transit Gateway | $20/TB — significant |
| vWAN hub charges | Azure | $0.25/hr per secured hub | $182.50/month per hub |
| App Gateway min CU | Azure | Minimum capacity even at zero traffic | $180/month fixed |
| Cross-region ER Premium | Azure | Premium add-on required for cross-geo | +50-100% port fee |
