### Data Plans

| Plan | How It Works | Best For |
|---|---|---|

| **Local SKU** | Port fee only (free egress to local region) | Single-region workloads near peering location |

Unlimited surcharge varies by speed (e.g., ~$550/month for 1 Gbps unlimited on top of port fee).

### ExpressRoute Add-Ons

| FastPath (bypass gateway for data plane) | Included with Ultra/ErGw3AZ |
| ExpressRoute Gateway (ErGw1Az) | ~$0.19/hr ($139/month) |
| ExpressRoute Gateway (ErGw3Az) | ~$1.07/hr ($781/month) |

```bash
# Check ExpressRoute circuit details and usage
az network express-route show --name <circuit-name> -g <rg> \
  --query '{sku:sku, bandwidth:bandwidthInMbps, peeringLocation:peeringLocation}'

# Check ExpressRoute circuit stats
az network express-route stats show --name <circuit-name> -g <rg>

# List available peering locations
az network express-route list-service-providers --query '[].{Provider:name, Locations:peeringLocations}'
```

Data transfer **in** via Direct Connect is free.

### Transit Gateway with Direct Connect

| Component | Cost |
|---|---|
| DX Gateway | Free |
| Transit Gateway attachment | $0.05/hr (~$36.50/month) |
| TGW data processing | $0.02/GB |

```bash
# Check Direct Connect connections
aws directconnect describe-connections \
  --query 'connections[].{Id:connectionId,Bandwidth:bandwidth,State:connectionState,Location:location}'

# Check virtual interfaces
aws directconnect describe-virtual-interfaces \
  --query 'virtualInterfaces[].{Name:virtualInterfaceName,Type:virtualInterfaceType,Vlan:vlan,State:virtualInterfaceState}'

# Check data transfer costs
aws ce get-cost-and-usage --time-period Start=2024-01-01,End=2024-02-01 \
  --granularity MONTHLY --metrics BlendedCost \
  --filter '{"Dimensions":{"Key":"SERVICE","Values":["AWS Direct Connect"]}}'
```

## GCP Cloud Interconnect Pricing

### Dedicated Interconnect

| Speed | VLAN Attachment ($/month) | Port Fee |
|---|---|---|
| 10 Gbps | $1,700/month per attachment | Included |
| 100 Gbps | $17,000/month per attachment | Included |

Minimum of one 10 Gbps connection. Production SLA requires two connections in different edge availability domains.

### Partner Interconnect

| Speed | $/month (approx.) |
|---|---|
| 50 Mbps | $55 |
| 100 Mbps | $110 |
| 200 Mbps | $165 |

| 10 Gbps | $1,700 |

### Egress Discounts with Interconnect

Traffic egressing through Interconnect receives discounted pricing compared to internet egress:

| Monthly Volume | Interconnect Egress ($/GB) | Internet Egress Premium ($/GB) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 1 TB | $0.02 | $0.12 |
| 1 – 10 TB | $0.02 | $0.11 |
| 10 TB+ | $0.02 | $0.08 |

```bash
# Check Interconnect attachments
gcloud compute interconnects attachments list --format='table(name,region,bandwidth,state)'

## Break-Even Analysis: VPN vs. Dedicated Circuit

### Azure — VPN vs. ExpressRoute

| Monthly Egress | VPN (VpnGw1AZ) | ER 50 Mbps Metered | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100 GB | $263 + $9 = $272 | $55 + $3 = $58 | **ER** |
| 500 GB | $263 + $44 = $307 | $55 + $13 = $68 | **ER** |
| 2 TB | $263 + $174 = $437 | $55 + $50 = $105 | **ER** |
| 5 TB | $263 + $419 = $682 | $55 + $125 = $180 | **ER** |

> Azure VPN gateways are more expensive per-hour than ER circuits at lower speeds. ER is often cheaper even at modest bandwidth — the break-even favors ER quickly if you need reliable bandwidth.

### AWS — VPN vs. Direct Connect

| Monthly Egress | S2S VPN | DX 1 Gbps Hosted ($22/mo) | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100 GB | $37 + $9 = $46 | $22 + $2 = $24 | **DX** |
| 1 TB | $37 + $90 = $127 | $22 + $20 = $42 | **DX** |
| 5 TB | $37 + $430 = $467 | $22 + $100 = $122 | **DX** |

> AWS VPN is cheap per-hour but egress adds up. DX hosted connections at lower speeds can be very cost-effective even at modest volumes, especially with partner pricing.

### GCP — VPN vs. Partner Interconnect

| Monthly Egress | HA VPN (2 tunnels) | Partner 100 Mbps | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100 GB | $110 + $12 = $122 | $110 + $2 = $112 | **Comparable** |
| 1 TB | $110 + $110 = $220 | $110 + $20 = $130 | **Interconnect** |
| 5 TB | $110 + $440 = $550 | $110 + $100 = $210 | **Interconnect** |
